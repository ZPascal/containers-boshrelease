  This job allows you to colocate local users who are immediately
  dumped into a container running an image of their choice, with
  their persistent home directories mounted.

  This enables a jumpbox-like experience, without needing constant
  redeploys to pick up new tools, updates, and environmental
  customizations.

  users:
    description: |
      A list of local users, their SSH keys, and prefered images.
      To specify more than one authorized key in the `key` property,
      just make it a newline string, or a list.

      The full list of supported keys (per user entry) is:

        username       (required) The username for this user.

        key            (required) The SSH authorized key for this user.

        image                     The Docker image to spin up for this
                                  user when they log in successfully.

        home                      The path (in the container) to mount
                                  this users home directory into.

        shell                     The login shell to use (in-container).

        group                     The name of the user's primary group
                                  (on the VM).  Defaults to `default.group`,
                                  and if that is missing, the user is put
                                  in a group all by themselves.

        env                       A map of environment variable names,. to
                                  their values.  The user's container will
                                  always have those set.

        mounts                    A list of volume mounts to mount into this
                                  users jumpbox container.  Follows the same
                                  format used by `default.mounts`.

                                  Any entry in the list that consists solely
                                  of the string `"defaults"` will be replaced
                                  with the value of `default.mounts`, inline.

    example: |
      users:
        - username: jhunt
          image:    'huntprod/jumpbox:jhunt'
          key:       ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1...JvthCmK jhunt@laptop

  default.image:
    default:     'huntprod/cf-jumpbox:latest'
    description: |
      The default image to use for users who do not have one listed
      explicitly.  The Dockerfile for the _default_ default image
      can be found in the `docker-boshrelease` GitHub repository,
      under `jumpbox/`.

  default.home:
    default:     /home/(username)
    description: |
      The default path (in the container) where the users persistent
      home directory will be mounted.  The string `(username)` will
      be replaced by the actual username for the account.

  default.shell:
    default:     /bin/bash
    description: |
      The default login shell to use (in the container) for accounts
      that do not explicitly specify one.  This should probably exist
      inside of whatever image you set for `default.image`.

  default.group:
    description: |
      A default shared group to put all jumpbox users in.  If this is
      not specified, then each user will be put in their own group,
      that contains them and only them.

  merge_environments:
    default: true
    description: |
      Whether or not to use the `default.env` set of environment
      variables as a basis, with per-user overrides.  If set to false,
      then `default.env` will be wholly ignored if the `env` key is
      set for a particular user.

  default.env:
    description: |
      A map of environment variables to their values, for all users.

      If the `merge_environments` directive is set to true, this list
      will be used as a base, and each specified environment variable
      can be set at a per-user level, to oeverride.  This is the
      default behavior.

      If `merge_environments` is set to false, however, the user set of
      environment variables will take precedence (if given), and none
      of these defaults will be used.

  default.mounts:
    description: |
      A list of volume mounts that all user jumpbox containers will get,
      by default.  Each entry in the list specifies which volume or
      filesystem path to bind-mount, the mountpoint in the container,
      additional options, etc.

      The full list of supported keys (per mount) is:

        volume           The name of the volume (see `volumes`), or the
        filesystem       path to the BOSH VM filesystem to use as the
                         source of the mount.

        tmpfs            A boolean.  If true, the `volume` and `filesystem`
                         values will be ignored and a tmpfs mount will
                         be created instead.

        mountpoint       The path (inside the container) to mount the
                         source volume / filesystem at.

        options          A string to be passed to the underlying Docker
                         CLI for additional options for the mount.
                         These will be passed as-is to the `--mount`
                         command, with the `type`, `source`, and
                         `destination` keys already set.

  homes:
    default: /var/vcap/store/jumpbox/home
    description: |
      Where to store user home directories on the jumpbox/docker VM.
      Each user gets a directory underneath this path, which gets
      mounted into their container image every time they log in.

      By default, these home directories are stored on persistent disk;
      but if you need to move it, you can.  Note that BOSH will always
      have a `store` directory, even if you don't provision a persistent
      disk to mount it on.

  volumes:
    default: []
    description: |
      A list of volumes to define on-disk, and make available to be
      bind-mounted into jumpbox containers on a per-user basis, or
      globally (via `default.mounts`).

      The full list of supported keys (per volume) is:

        name           (required) The name of the volume.  From this,
                                  the path on persistent storage will
                                  be derived.

        user                      The username of the account that owns
                                  the underlying volume directory.
                                  Defaults to 'root' (uid 0).

        group                     The name of the group that owns the
                                  underlying volume directory.
                                  Defaults to 'root' (gid 0).

        mode                      The permissions, in octal, to set on
                                  the underlying volume directory.
                                  Defaults to '0775'.  Don't forget to
                                  quote this to avoid YAML interpreting
                                  it as a number.
